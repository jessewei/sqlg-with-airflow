*** Welcome to the ETL Best practices with airflow repository.

This is the source code for all the documentation, which is hosted at:

https://gtoonstra.github.io/etl-with-airflow/

** Disclaimer

This is not the official documentation site for
Apache airflow. This site is not affiliated, monitored or controlled by
the official Apache Airflow development effort. If you are looking for
the official documentation site, please follow this link:
  
https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/
    
What you will find here are interesting examples, usage patterns and
ETL principles that I thought are going to help people use airflow to
much better effect.
